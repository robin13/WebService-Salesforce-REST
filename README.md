# WebService::Salesforce::REST

This module provides an interface to the Salesforce REST API.  It is currently a work in progress (alpha) module with a very incomplete set of functions provided, _but_ I hope the framework I started is simple enough for you to extend it if you need any API endpoints which are not currently supported.  I love pull requests! :)

# Atribution

Thanks to my super duper employer [Elastic.co](https://www.elastic.co/) for making development of this module possible.
